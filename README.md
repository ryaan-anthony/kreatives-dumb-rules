Hey /r/magento,

It's been awhile since you have heard from us, and with the growing visitor base we feel its time to put some rules in place and we need your feedback on some proposed rule changes. Here are some rules we've borrowed/tweaked from other subreddits but we would like some input from everyone.

## Posting Guidelines
* Please provide links that are useful resources and will help out a community of professionally minded web developers.
Please feel free to ask for help or advice, but if you do be as thorough as possible about your current problem and explain what you're trying to achieve and specifically what can be done to help! Please don't beg for advice or help.
* Read reddiquette.
* No self-promotion unless you are a participating /r/magento member with a healthy ratio of promotion to discussion.
* Text posts with self-promo links are also not permitted.

## Do Not Post / Comment
* Blog Spam - "A blog where the author paraphrases or copies from the original article/webpage in an attempt to increase his or her own traffic. This becomes a waste of the reader's time forcing them to click through the blog to get to the actual article."
* Theme/Plugin/Services advertising - This includes "how to" posts that recommend themes, plugins or services to do things. Consider reddit advertising instead. If you are working on an open source or free plugin.
* Destructive Criticism - The opposite of constructive criticism.

## Notes
* Distributing copyright material is against our community policy. Unless it is yours or you have the license stating that redistributing is allowed.
* If you or your company has an interest in promoting a product or service please message the mods beforehand to clear it with us.
* Your reddit account must be older than 1 month to submit LINK posts. Text posts are fine. This is because the majority of spam posts are coming from brand new users who have not read the posting rules listed above.
* We are open to AMA's so please coordinate with the moderators.
* Job meta posts are allowed, we suggest you use [JOB] in the title.

Let us know what you think and thanks again for your input,

/u/kreative & /r/magento mods.

EDIT 1: Removed the no meme rule.
